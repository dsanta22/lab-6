                The Doctorate of Science in <a
                    href="https://math.gatech.edu/graduate/phd-computational-sciences-and-engineering">Computational
                    Science and Engineering (CSE) Program</a> is an interdisciplinary
                program offered by the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, and the College of Sciences.
                The
                CSE program addresses the body of knowledge, skills, and practices associated with the study of
                computer-based
                models of natural phenomena and engineered systems. Students will be required to obtain a breadth of
                knowledge
                across a set of core areas in the CSE discipline, depth of knowledge in a specific computational
                specialization
                (e.g., numerical computing), and knowledge to apply computational techniques in a domain of application.
                Students
                will be expected to integrate principles from mathematics, computer science, and engineering to be able
                to create
                significant computational artifacts (e.g., software).
